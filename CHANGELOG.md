Created branch and input sample-data from another repo that has done something similar to us.Data was scraped from the site, courtesy of [j2kun](https://github.com/j2kun/math-genealogy-scraper/blob/main/data.json). Note, the data is old and is only to 2019-06-17. This is just a way to help me work on the actual content faster.
