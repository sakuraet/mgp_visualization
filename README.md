# Mathematics Genealogy Project Visualization 

# Website

Code on the website's structure. Includes the Home page, where the MGP Visualization will be displayed, and the About page, where details on us and the project are located.

# Instructions (How to Run Application)

As of right now, we recommend users to fork the library and run the code locally. We are using React as our framework, so `npm` is used to run it. Once the user has a local version, it only requires `npm start` once the dependencies are installed.
